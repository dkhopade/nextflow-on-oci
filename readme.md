This repo helps install nextflow on Oracle Cloud Infrastrucure (OCI) and help you run and manage nextflow pipelines using OCI's HPC Cluster with SLURM.

## Description
This repository provides a comprehensive toolkit for deploying, configuring, and managing Nextflow workflows on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI).

Nextflow is a powerful and popular system for creating scalable and reproducible scientific workflows. OCI offers highly performant and cost-effective bare metal compute instances ideal for High-Performance Computing (HPC) workloads.

The goal is to provide a straightforward path for researchers and bioinformaticians to run their existing Nextflow pipelines on an enterprise-grade cloud HPC environment, specifically using an OCI HPC Cluster powered by GPUs managed by the SLURM scheduler.

Key Features
Automated Installation: Includes scripts to provision and install Nextflow on an OCI compute inclusterstance (e.g., a cluster head node and worker nodes).

SLURM Scheduler Support: Enables Nextflow to seamlessly submit pipeline tasks as jobs to the SLURM scheduler, allowing for massive parallelization and efficient resource management across the cluster.

Data Management: Includes best practices and examples for staging data to and from OCI Object Storage for use in your pipelines.
